# FrostTuneIQ
FrostTuneIQ brings intelligence to Apache Iceberg with autonomous data layout optimization. It learns from real workloads, predicts hot partitions, dynamically re-clusters and compacts data, and validates improvements reducing costs and boosting performance without manual tuning.

**Autonomous Intelligence + Optimization for Apache Iceberg**

---

## 🧊 What is FrostTuneIQ?

FrostTuneIQ is an experimental **self-learning optimization layer** for modern data lakehouses built on **Apache Iceberg**.  
Instead of relying on static partitions, periodic compaction, and manual tuning, FrostTuneIQ continuously observes query workloads and **optimizes data layouts dynamically** — making your data lake smarter, faster, and cheaper.

---

## 🌟 Key Features (Planned / In Progress)

- **Workload Telemetry Capture**  
  Continuously collects query patterns filters, joins, scan ranges, latency, and cost metrics.

- **Machine Learning Forecasting**  
  Predicts **hot partitions**, cardinality shifts, and workload spikes before they impact performance.

- **Dynamic Optimization Actions**  
  Adjusts partition specs, reclusters data, and triggers compaction **automatically**.

- **Autonomous Validation**  
  Runs **canary** workloads to measure improvements, with safe rollback if changes backfire.

## ❄️ Where the Name Came From

- **Frost** → Refers to cold storage and the Iceberg project.  
- **Tune** → Represents performance tuning and optimization.  
- **IQ** → Highlights the **intelligence** layer powered by machine learning.

Together: **FrostTuneIQ** = *Iceberg + Intelligence + Optimization.*

---

## 🚀 Vision

To make Apache Iceberg **self-optimizing**, bridging the worlds of **data engineering** and **data science**, and enabling:

- Reduced compute costs  
- Consistent, faster query latency  
- Zero manual intervention

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started (Concept Stage)

> Currently in **concept and design** phase — contributions and discussions are welcome.  
> Planned implementation includes: Spark / Trino workloads on Iceberg tables with ML-driven layout optimization.
